// Grid
//
// The grid is based on 12 columns for breakpoints `large` and up.
// Smaller breakpoints uses a 2 column layout.
// The `@`-sign is used to determine at what breakpoint this grid is used.
// An element with the classes `o-1-2@xsmall-large` and `o-8-12@large` will be
// 1/2 of the available screen size at breakpoints small to large, and 8/12 of
// the available size at breakpoints large and up.
